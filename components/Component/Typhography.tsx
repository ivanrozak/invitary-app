      Determining the correct line height for a text styles is important to
      ensure legibility. Determining the correct line height can differ between
      different typefaces and sizes, so it’s important to adjust and experiment
      until it looks and “feels” right — it’s not an exact science. As a general
      rule (and a good starting point), body text should be between 1.5 to 2x
      the text size, depending on the width and length of the content. For
      example, if your body text is 16px, set the line height to 1.5 or 24px. To
      complicate things further, there is an inverse relationship between font
      size and appropriate line height — the larger the text, the smaller the
      line height should be. As a general rule for display text (headings etc.),
      aiming for 1 to 1.25x is usually a safe bet. For example, if your display
      text is 60px, set the line height to ~1.2 or 72px and see how that looks.
      We’ve stress-tested Untitled’s typographic scale across dozens of projects
      to make sure it’s robust enough to use across (almost) any project.
